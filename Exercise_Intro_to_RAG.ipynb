    "Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, has emerged to be one of the most popular techniques in the applied generative AI world. Large Language Models, or LLMs, is a generative AI technology that has recently gained tremendous popularity. However, despite their unprecedented ability to generate text, their responses are __not always correct__. Upon more careful observation, you may notice that LLM responses are plagued with __sub-optimal information__ and __inherent memory limitations__.  RAG addresses these limitations of LLMs by providing them with information __external__ to these models. Thereby, resulting in LLM responses that are more reliable and trustworthy. "

(https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-09163-002) and a chunk is a familiar collection of elementary units. The idea is that chunking is an essential technique through which human beings perceive the world and commit to memory. The simplest example is how we remember long sequences of digits like phone numbers, credit card numbers, dates or even OTPs. We don’t remember the entire sequences but in our minds, we break them down into chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of chunking in RAG and the underlying idea is somewhat similar to what it is in real life. Once you’ve extracted and parsed text from the source, instead of committing it all to memory as a single element, you break it down into smaller chunks.\n",

    "### <span style=\"color:#47c7fc\">Understanding Chunking: Why is it necessary ?</span>\n",
    "There are two main benefits of chunking —\n",
    "\n",
    "- It leads to better retrieval of information. If a chunk represents a single idea (or fact) it can be retrieved with more confidence that if there are multiple ideas (or facts) within the same chunk.\n",
    "- It leads to better generation. The retrieved chunk has information that is focussed on the user query and does not have any other text that may confuse the LLM. Therefore, the generation is more accurate and coherent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from these two benefits there are two limitations of LLMs that chunking addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Context Window of LLMs__: LLMs, due to the inherent nature of the technology, have a limit on the number of tokens (loosely, words) they can work with at a time. This includes both the number of tokens in the prompt (or the input) and the number of tokens in the completion (or the output). The limit on the total number of tokens that an LLM can process in one go is called the context window size. If we pass an input that is longer than the context window size, the LLM chooses to ignore all text beyond the size. It becomes very important to be careful with the amount to text that is being passed to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Lost in the middle problem__: Even in those LLMs which have a long context window (Claude 3 by Anthropic has a context window of up to 200,00 tokens), an issue with accurately reading the information has been observed. It has been noticed that accuracy declines dramatically if the relevant information is somewhere in the middle of the prompt. This problem can be addressed by passing only the relevant information to the LLM instead of the entire document."

    "The aim of chunking is to keep meaningful data together. If we are dealing with data in form of HTML, Markdown, JSON or even computer code, it makes more sense to split the data based on the structure rather than a fixed size. Another approach for chunking is to take into consideration the format of the extracted and loaded data. A markdown file, for example is organised by headers, a code written in a programming language like python or java is organized by classes and functions and HTML, likewise, is organised in headers and sections. For such formats a specialised chunking approach can be employed.\n",

    "- Markdown: Split based on headers (e.g., #, ##, ###)\n",
